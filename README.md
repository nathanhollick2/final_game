# final_game
This project is a choose your own adventure style game in renpy.

Some of the challanges I faced was getting used to the commands in renpy.  It oddly took me a really long time to adjust to the new lingo, but I overcame this obsticle.

I also struggled with debugging, this may be the longest code I have written before, so searching for bugs throughout the development of the game was very hard.

I really struggled making my function to verify the characters being entered in decisions.  It was really hard for me, but I ultimately came up with a function that simply had to be used as opposed to input statements.  

I learned alot about software, and specifically how to get comfortable in new software

I also learned that your first project will most likely not be your last. I had made so many different versions of this game I titled them by numbers for a while.
